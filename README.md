# Exbar

This is my Java implementation of the Exbar (Lang, K. J., 1999) algorithm for inferring a minimum size DFA (deterministic finite automaton) consistent with a training set. 
Please refer to the research paper “[Faster algorithms for finding minimal consistent DFAs][1]” for additional details.
